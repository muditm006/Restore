To speed healing, rest your leg, ice it for fifteen to twenty minutes (every two to three hours) to reduce pain and swelling, and compress and elevate your leg when you are sitting or lying down. Once the swelling and pain is lessened enough to resume movement, begin restoring your ankle's range of motion, strength, flexibility and stability with exercises.

To speed healing, give your arm proper rest by refraining from engaging in sports, heavy work activities, and other activities that cause painful symptoms for several weeks. Additionally, apply ice or a cold pack for fifteen minutes (three to four times a day). Once the pain eases, start practicing exercises that stretch and strengthen your muscles.

To speed healing in either case, avoid strenuous activity, apply an ice pack for ten to twenty minutes at regular intervals to reduce inflammation (shortly after the muscle is injured), use heating pads on your lower back for ten minutes before getting out of bed to increase circulation (only around 48 hours after the injury occurs), and attempt walking for a few minutes every day to relieve low back stiffness and reduce discomfort/pain.
